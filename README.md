# 🚗 Driver Alertness Detection System (Real-Time)

A real-time **driver safety monitoring system** designed to detect driver drowsiness and inattentiveness using live camera input.  
The system helps prevent road accidents by identifying signs of fatigue and triggering alerts when unsafe conditions are detected.

## 📘 Project Overview

Driver fatigue is one of the leading causes of road accidents worldwide.  
This project focuses on improving road safety by continuously monitoring the driver’s facial features through a camera feed and detecting alertness levels in real time.

When signs of drowsiness or inattention are detected, the system immediately raises alerts to warn the driver.

This solution is suitable for:
- Road safety systems
- Smart vehicle monitoring
- Fleet & transport safety
- Driver assistance applications

## 🔍 How It Works

1. The system captures live video from the camera.
2. Facial landmarks (eyes, face) are detected frame by frame.
3. Eye movement and blinking patterns are analyzed.
4. If prolonged eye closure or inattentiveness is detected:
   - A warning alert is triggered
   - The driver is notified immediately
5. Monitoring continues in real time.
